🔮 Future Scope: Machine Learning Integration

The current version of SoilSense uses a rule-based AI (expert system) to ensure explainability, transparency, and reliability in agronomic decision-making.

In future iterations, the system is designed to support Machine Learning integration without requiring changes to the API or frontend layers.

A dedicated ml_models module is reserved for:

Training supervised ML models on historical soil and crop data

Predicting soil health risk probabilities

Enhancing recommendations using data-driven insights

This layered design allows the system to evolve from deterministic AI to hybrid AI + ML as data availability increases.
